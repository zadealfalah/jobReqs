We make the American safety net simpler, easier to access, and more responsive to the lives of real people.\n   The big idea behind the Lab is simple: when we make policy away from the people it impacts most, or rely on the tools of past eras to administer it, it tends to fail in delivery. The only way to improve delivery is to bring users back into the process through the use of more modern and participatory design tools. This approach can and does improve delivery, and what we learn along the way offers powerful insights that reshape the way the next generation of policymakers does its work.\n   With this cycle in mind, our work rests on two critical pillars of activity:\n  \n  We run \u201cdelivery sprints,\u201d or focused intense projects with clear scope of work that engages families and government partners to identify changes the government can make to improve delivery and/or uptake of key services within the public benefits system. \n  We carry the insights of real families into the policymaking process to center delivery in policy design.  \n Role Description \n  To meaningfully affect change in how policy is designed and delivered, members of the Lab work closely together across two disciplines of policy and product delivery. The Data Engineering Lead will be a critical member of the Lab\u2019s product team who will work closely with the Lab\u2019s Director of Product, Data and Strategic Impact Lead, and design and policy teams to ensure the ultimate success and impact of the Lab.
