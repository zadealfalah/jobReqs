Inspect and cleanse procurement data. \\n Continuous Improvement:  Analyze data and current business practices and make recommendations for continuous improvement of key deliverables. Analyze KPIs and provide recommended actions to meet business objectives. \\n Collaborate:  Meet consistently with other departments to get production and sales feedback and to present key reports like overstock and reorder suggestions.

If you're not, then tell us why that won’t negatively impact you in this job. \\n \\n  Requirements \\n \\n College degree in Economics, Finance, Information Systems, General Business or similar, or equivalent work experience. \\n 5+ years experience in a data-focused role within procurement or purchasing. \\n Knowledge and deep experience in the use of Forecasting tools, ERP systems and Reporting tools. \\n Advanced knowledge of Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and/or Numbers (Mac).
