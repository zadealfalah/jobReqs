It means looking at the world and making sure we embody as many of its best qualities as we can, and striving for that as a matter of principle, not as a marketing goal we check off a list. \\n  This is how we strive to practice: We define diversity as making sure (1) our table represents people from varying backgrounds, (2) inclusion as making sure our people have a seat at the table, and (3) equity as making sure our people have the same means to get to the table in the first place. Externally, we apply the same policies to partnerships, marketing, and product development. \\n  Ultimately, diversity goes beyond what we look like, who we are, who we love or how we think. Diversity is shorthand for an integrity-driven way of operating and growing every single day, and we wouldn't have it any other way.\"},\n",

The premise of our lifestyle guidelines is to exemplify such personal, moral, and religious conduct as shall be above reproach. This lifestyle premise is for everyone working and living on campus: students, faculty, staff, and administration. This lifestyle premise is a rationale for desirable behavior and attitudes. \\n  We, as a Christian community, commit ourselves to the admonition of the Apostle Paul that we build our community up in love for each other. We will actively endeavor to be supportive and caring for each other in spite of whatever differences may develop concerning the operation of the College. While honest differences may exist and be vigorously debated, the College will not condone personal attacks on other members of the community. \\n  To be in accord with the purposes and spirit of the College and with the doctrines and standards of the Church of the Nazarene, our lifestyle practices exclude: engaging in sexual acts outside of Christian marriage as defined by the Church of the Nazarene, the use of pornography, any acts of abuse, bullying or harassment, the use of profanity, gambling, theft, dishonesty, using tobacco in any form, participation in the occult and any other behavior that is detrimental to authentic Christian community and the maintenance of an atmosphere conducive to abundant life. \\n  The historic understanding of ENC and the Church of the Nazarene with respect to alcohol is that abstinence best reflects our commitments to Christ, to our community and to holy living. This position is rooted in our acknowledgement of the destructive consequences in individuals, families and communities that can stem from the use of alcohol and demonstrates our commitment to standing in solidarity with those who have suffered from these consequences. As a result, it continues to be our strong preference that all employees abstain from the use of alcoholic beverages. However, we respect the fact that our employees come from a variety of denominational backgrounds that may not share this commitment to abstinence. Our expectation, therefore, is that all employees will abide by the behavioral commitments of their local church, will avoid drunkenness, and will under no circumstances possess, use, promote or distribute alcoholic beverages on campus, at any college event, or in the presence of students. \\n  Additionally, ENC prohibits the possession, use, distribution or manufacture of illegal drugs and recreational marijuana, and the misuse of prescription drugs. \\n  The College expects all employees to live by this lifestyle premise. We ask for an understanding of the need for lifestyle standards, a good spirit in keeping them, and cooperative efforts in improving them. As ENC employees, we ask you to consider the larger picture that what we do and the manner in which we do it reflects on ENC and affects the life of our entire community. We encourage prayerful discernment in all decision-making, as our desire is to glorify God in all our efforts. \\n  Equal Opportunity  Eastern Nazarene College policy prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion*, age, color, creed, national or ethnic origin, marital status, disability, genetic information, or any other protected class in all aspects of employment including the decision to hire, promote, discipline, or discharge. We actively encourage applications from underrepresented groups.* \\n \\n Christian Faith and employment at Eastern Nazarene College: Eastern Nazarene College is an expression of the Church of the Nazarene. It reserves the right to prefer employees on the basis of religion (Title VII, Section 702-703, U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964). Preferred candidates demonstrate a strong commitment to the Christian faith, active participation in a local church, and a philosophy of Christian higher education consistent with the Wesleyan tradition. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Contact Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Office Human Resources  Eastern Nazarene College  23 E.

UFCIC targets property and casualty insurance for small businesses that are managed in such a way that they deserve to qualify for, and enjoy, the additional advantages in security and coverage offered by an admitted product. While the surplus market, as a last resort channel, can provide a reduced coverage form at a higher price, UFCIC turns this dynamic upside down. Via a higher standard of acceptance, expert underwriting rules, advanced analytics, machine learning, and external data sources to supplement standard risk information, the majority of UFCIC’s target business can “graduate” from the surplus lines and be provided with a superior coverage form in the admitted marketplace. For those risks that necessitate the surplus market, our company uses our E&S carrier, Shield Indemnity, for risk placement. UFCIC also serves the specialty surety bond marketplace by providing a variety of proprietary, cutting-edge, and competitively priced surety products available through efficient direct and agent based technology enabled portals. Via UFCBonds.com (B2C), customers can buy License and Permit bonds direct, as well as other types of surety bonds, with zero commissions and fees – savings are up to 25% compared to online agency based surety bond platforms. For business to business (B2B), our BondRamp.com platform serves our distributors for surety bond placement. Additionally, UFCBonds.com and BondRamp.com issue most bonds instantly and are available 24x7x365 and accessible by computer, tablet, or mobile device. UFCIC is part of the Universal Shield Insurance Group (www.universalshield.com). Universal Shield is composed of Universal Fire & Casualty Insurance Company (www.ufcic.com) - an admitted carrier - and Shield Indemnity Inc.
