Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, as well as our Code Search product, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We're building software that builds software, and in doing so we're making devs more productive and growing the population of coders by giving anybody access to the deep knowledge base of a senior engineer through Cody and all of the context it brings. We're preparing for a world with a lot more code than exists today, and that benefits us all. \n  It's an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. AI has taken over the world, and we've spent the last 10 years building infrastructure that's integral to making AI generated code more powerful and accurate. Our customers include 4/5 FAANG companies, 4 of the top 10 banks, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward.

We're making ambitious bets on our future and we're looking to hire exceptional people to join our team as we make Sourcegraph one of the biggest and most influential companies in the world. \n \n  Working hours \n  Given that we are an all-remote company and hire almost anywhere in the world, we don't have a particular time-zone preference for this role. However, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours. \n  Why this job is exciting \n  We are creating a machine learning team at Sourcegraph, aimed at creating the most powerful coding assistant in the world. Many companies are trying, but Sourcegraph is uniquely differentiated by our rich code intelligence data and powerful code search platform. In the world of prompting LLMs, context is everything, and Sourcegraph's context is simply the best you can get: IDE-quality, global-scale, and served lightning fast. Our code intelligence, married with modern AI, is already providing a remarkable alpha experience, and you can help us unlock its full potential. \n  We are looking for a polyglot AI/ML hacker, versed in programming language semantics, with a strong AI/ML background, who can help us deliver the world's best coding assistant, built on our mature, robust, and open code intelligence platform. And if you happen to have an entrepreneurial streak, you're in luck: We have an enterprise distribution pipeline, so whatever you build can be deployed straight to enterprise customers with some of the largest code bases in the world, without all the go-to-market hassle you'd encounter in a startup. \n  You will be a scientist at Sourcegraph doing R&D, and pushing the boundaries of what AI can do, as an IC on our new ML team. You will have the full power of Sourcegraph's Code Intelligence Platform at your disposal, and you'll be working on a coding assistant that is already awesome, so this is a greenfield opportunity to multiply dev productivity to unprecedented levels. \n  Within one month, you will\u2026 \n \n Start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure. \n Be set up to do local development, and be actively prototyping. \n Dive deep into how AI and ML is already used at Sourcegraph and identify ways to improve moving forward. \n Ship a substantial new feature to end users. \n \n  Within three months, you will\u2026 \n \n Be seen as a subject matter expert in all things AI at Sourcegraph. \n Be contributing actively to the world's best coding assistant. \n Be following all the relevant research, and conducting research of your own. \n \n  Within six months, you will\u2026 \n \n Be fully ramped up and owning key pieces of the assistant. \n Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Sourcegraph product. \n Be helping design and build what might become the biggest dev accelerator in 20 years. \n \n About you \n  You are a polyglot hacker in the AI/ML space who wants to be part of a world-class team to push the boundaries of AI, with a particular focus on leveraging Sourcegraph's code intelligence to leapfrog competitors. \n  First, you have a deep understanding of programming languages, and tools that manipulate code. This could have taken any number of forms; e.g.: \n \n You've worked with grammars and parser generators, or Treesitter \n You've worked with compilers and semantic analysis, e.g. type systems \n You've written an interpreter, or worked on a virtual machine \n You've done static analysis involving scanning source code for semantic information \n \n It doesn't really matter how you know it, but it's important that you're familiar with the basic concepts of semantic representations of source code, and how they're produced and consumed by tooling. \n  Second, your AI background could look like a few different things: \n \n You've worked on AI systems and have built ML at large tech companies. \n You have a deep ML background and have demonstrated an ability to be customer and company focused. You are hands-on and can build machine learning \n You are a Prompt Engineer and can take models and figure out how to speak to it in a way that yields different results \n You are an entrepreneurial engineer who can hack together prototypes quickly, get things out the door, and iterate \n You are an LLM hacker or a thought leader in the LLM space and can craft a roadmap that takes advantage of the space, especially with code intelligence \n You've worked in NLP or language models at a top-tier research lab \n \n If you've been anywhere near the field lately, you can probably pick up enough about LLM capabilities to be able to drive this space, as it's all greenfield. \n  Finally, you shouldn't be a purist about languages. We may need to integrate the coding assistant into a wide variety of tooling contexts, each with its own programming language. You may find yourself writing in several programming languages along the journey, and hopefully you already know most of them a little anyway. \n  Level \n  This job is an IC4.

You may have been a product manager running a product or product line before. You may have been an engineer who has been on the front lines of helping shape a company. You may have been a management consultant who has experience in a particular vertical. Or perhaps you are a proven entrepreneur who recognizes that the difference between success and failure is razor-thin, and you want every advantage you can get.\n    \n \n \n \n \n   Lastly, we want people who are leaders. We desire people who can hire great people, get others excited about their vision, raise capital, and make it all happen.\n   \n \n \n  About Portfolio Company: \n \n \n \n  As FIR, you will lead the development of an AI Avatar product, that will allow celebrities to have a one-on-one personalized relationship with their fans in a way that is engineered to be safe, and authentic with their brand.\n   \n \n \n \n  What You Will Be Doing:  \n \n \n The FIR will work with the AI Fund Leadership Team to launch and scale new businesses from the ground up.

Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity. \n Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information ( e.g ., identity theft) and/or money. The Company\u2019s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity. \n Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams: \n 1. Always Check the Source: \n Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities. \n 2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information: \n We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam. \n 3. Verify Contact Information: \n Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information.

Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig-economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees.The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options.Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously. Legion WFM was built for the cloud, designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses, and meet the needs of today's hourly employees.
