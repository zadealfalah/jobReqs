A nonprofit private operating foundation whose origins date to 1946, the Lincoln Institute researches and recommends creative approaches to land as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges. Through education, training, publications, and events, we integrate theory and practice to inform public policy decisions worldwide. With locations in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Washington, DC; Phoenix; and Beijing, we organize our work around six goals: low-carbon, climate-resilient communities and regions; efficient and equitable tax systems; reduced poverty and spatial inequality; fiscally healthy communities and regions; sustainably managed land and water resources; and functional land markets and reduced informality.\n  \n \n \n  Internet of Water Overview \n \n \n   In the United States, water data has been collected by hundreds of federal, state, and local agencies for decades, yet we are still unable to answer fundamental questions about our water systems in a timely way: How much water is there?

Because the data have been collected by different agencies, for different purposes, at different scales, and are scattered across multiple platforms with different standards, they are rarely used beyond their original purpose. The Internet of Water is a bold vision to improve water data infrastructure and fundamentally transform water management.

Your role will be pivotal in ensuring the reliability, security, and compliance of our services, contributing to the success of our clients' compliance initiatives while upholding the highest standards of performance and resilience. \n  WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU TO DO \n \n You'll work with our seasoned team of software development engineers, software reliability engineers, product managers, and customer support team to deliver an outstanding product and customer experience. \n You'll spearhead the transformation of our services into \"infrastructure as code,\" eliminating manual steps and enhancing deployment efficiency, a critical task for our EU++ data center operations. \n You'll work on the creation and maintenance of deployment scripts, ensuring seamless and consistent software releases that meet the stringent requirements of the compliance landscape. \n You'll assume responsibility for disaster recovery processes, meticulously crafting procedures and conducting drills to ensure our systems are well-prepared for any disruptions. \n You'll manage and optimize our Elasticsearch services, including dynamic scaling to accommodate increased demand while maintaining peak performance. \n You'll implement robust change management monitoring across all services, aligning with FedRAMP requirements to ensure compliance and transparent change tracking. \n You'll work closely with the engineering and test teams to ensure that the configuration and tooling of the local development environment enables our engineering team to efficiently deliver quality code. \n You'll drive the automation of password rolling processes, enhancing security and reducing manual intervention. \n You'll work closely with colleagues to automate data warehouse pipelines and resource management, contributing to the efficiency of our data-centric operations. \n You'll evaluate and recommend infrastructure management tools such as Terraform, Bicep, and others, to continuously improve our deployment and management capabilities. \n You'll actively participate in continuous improvement initiatives, collaborating across departments to foster excellence in our operations. \n \n HOW YOU'LL KNOW YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL \n  In the fast-paced world of technology and software development, success is a multifaceted concept. For a Compliance SaaS company like Hypeproof, success is defined not only by the innovation of its solutions but also by the effectiveness of its DevOps practices. The continuous integration of development and operations, underpinned by automation and collaboration, plays a pivotal role in ensuring Hypeproof's success in delivering cutting-edge compliance solutions. But how will they know when they've truly succeeded? Let's delve into the key indicators that will signal triumph on their DevOps journey. \n \n Seamless Deployment Process : One of the first signs of DevOps success for Hypeproof is the seamless deployment of software updates and enhancements. If the deployment process is streamlined and consistently delivers new features without disrupting the user experience, it's a clear indicator that DevOps practices are effectively aligning with the company's objectives. The automation of deployment scripts and the implementation of \"infrastructure as code\" significantly contribute to the smooth rollout of updates, allowing Hypeproof to stay agile and responsive to market needs. \n Enhanced Data Security and Compliance:  For a Compliance SaaS company, data security and regulatory compliance are paramount. Success is measured by the ability to maintain and even elevate these standards over time. If Hypeproof can consistently demonstrate adherence to industry compliance standards such as FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and more, while efficiently managing change and access control through automation, it showcases their commitment to security and positions them as leaders in the field. \n Resilient Disaster Recovery:  In the event of disruptions, a successful DevOps approach enables rapid recovery and minimal downtime. Conducting drills to test disaster recovery procedures and consistently fine-tuning them ensures that Hypeproof's services remain available and reliable even under challenging circumstances. The ability to swiftly recover from incidents signifies a mature DevOps culture that prioritizes resilience and customer satisfaction. \n Scalability and Elasticity : As Hypeproof's client base grows, the platform's ability to scale to meet demand becomes a litmus test for DevOps success. If the Elasticsearch services can scale dynamically to accommodate increased usage, without compromising performance, it's a testament to the successful implementation of DevOps practices. This scalability reflects an infrastructure that's adaptable to changing needs, ensuring an exceptional user experience regardless of user volume. \n Continuous Monitoring and Improvement : A thriving DevOps culture thrives on continuous improvement. If Hypeproof is consistently monitoring services, analyzing metrics, and making informed decisions based on data, they're on the right track. Regularly optimizing infrastructure, refining deployment processes, and adopting new tools demonstrate an ongoing commitment to excellence. \n Efficient Cost Management : DevOps success extends beyond technical efficiency to financial prudence. If Hypeproof can identify and address billing inefficiencies, such as optimizing storage and resource utilization, it reflects a holistic approach to operations. This cost-conscious mindset translates into tangible benefits for both the company and its clients. \n Collaborative Team Dynamics : Ultimately, DevOps isn't just about technology\u2014it's about people working together seamlessly. If Hypeproof's DevOps teams, including developers, operations personnel, and other stakeholders, are collaborating effectively, sharing knowledge, and collectively driving improvements, it's a strong indicator of a successful DevOps culture. Cross-functional collaboration accelerates innovation and problem-solving. \n \n In the world of DevOps, success isn't a one-time achievement; it's a journey of continuous improvement. For Hypeproof, success lies in the intersection of technological excellence, customer satisfaction, and a culture that values agility, collaboration, and innovation.
