Hiring Range: $61,357.00 - $95,093.00  Hours: 8:00am - 4:30pm    The City of Durham\u2019s nationally recognized, award-winning Technology Solutions Department builds and aligns the City\u2019s information technology infrastructure so that departments can deliver a superior level of public service. Our team is recognized nationally by the Public Technology Institute, ICMA Center for Performance Measurement and Digital Cities Survey. If you can offer the skills to innovate and the passion to serve, bring your talent to Durham.    The Enterprise Business Analyst is a member of the Business Relationship Management (BRM) Team. The BRM team helps integrate and facilitate emerging technologies and organizational change, as well as maintain strong relationships between Technology Solutions and partner departments, agencies, businesses, and residents. The BRM team promotes tools and practices that drive innovation and further the City\u2019s strategic plan and digital inclusion goals. The team communicates department priorities, seeks feedback, and develops educational resources. Specifically, the BRM team is responsible for Solution Development, virtual communications, and departmental outreach via TS liaisons, House Calls, and the IT Virtual Help Center.    Solution Development is the primary focus of the Enterprise Business Analyst (EBA) position.    The Enterprise Business Analyst is the lead analyst in the City's Solution Development process, which involves stakeholder engagement, technology assessment, independent research, formation of recommendations, and oral presentations. Solution Development is a process whereby new technology initiatives are proposed by City of Durham departments and then evaluated and prioritized by Technology Solutions staff. As part of the Solution Development process the Enterprise Business Analyst prepares Business Cases which chiefly capture the business need, value, costs, risks, and strategic alignment associated with the proposed technology initiative. Business Cases contain written and graphical narrative and data, and tell a cohesive story based on analysis and recommendations of the analyst through their own independent research and stakeholder consultation.    More complex Solution Development initiatives are ultimately brought before the City's IT Governance Steering Committee, which consists of key members of City leadership. The EBA is thereby a key player in the City of Durham\u2019s overall IT Governance process, which is a best practice adopted by many local governments throughout the United States. In addition to providing structure, data-driven analysis, and transparency, IT governance ensures technology initiatives deployed within the City are financially sustainable, secure, integrated within the organization, and aligned with the Citywide Strategic Plan.    This position is devoted to providing enterprise technology support and analysis for the City including strategic technology management and technology governance.    The EBA performs fully proficient analysis work requiring independent evaluation and analysis of issues. The EBA will be expected to work within established processes, exercise independent judgment, and apply criteria to resolve problems and make recommendations within the constraints established by management objectives and direction. The EBA will work effectively independently but must also be a strong team player. The EBA will engage, consult, and collaborate with colleagues and teams, and have keen awareness of when, what, and to whom, issues need to be communicated.    The EBA will also identify opportunities to streamline and enhance business processes and outcomes to add value to the Solution Development process and promote the overall communication and stakeholder engagement objectives of the Technology Solutions department.    The successful candidate will have a proven track record in analysis, project leadership, communication, collaboration, and information technology systems and tools. A strong background in IT, research methods, municipal government operations, and data analytics is advantageous.    An employee in this role is eligible for teleworking.

If so, you already know what we\u2019re trying to do. Building production software is hard. Making it so simple to use that it disappears into the background is harder. Doing that for healthcare data, which can be messy, is so hard that nobody has really done it.\n  \n \n \n  Data Services owns the core domains underpinning how we get our members to the right care at the right time.

They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them. \n \n Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact. \n  Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office.
