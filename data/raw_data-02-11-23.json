Contact center is a very unique beast compared to regular projects. So having that knowledge is critical. The core technology (Genesy, Avaya, RingCentral) etc. is not relevant. RingCentral and Pete's team have the technical infrastructure piece covered. Ultimately all these platforms are very similar. We need a BA to work closely with both our business groups to map out the current state and more importantly the future state. This will also require clearly mapping out the RingCentral features and which ones are relevant to our business and how we plan to use them. So any experience having done this in the past is critical. I am a big believer in team dynamics and the fit in our environment. So it's important to get a sense of the BAs personality and approach and if that can be a strength when added to our overall team Communication is key.
