Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades \u2014 because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades. \n  Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically: \n \n We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions. \n We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs \u2014 perfect for reinforcement learning. \n We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code.

Accelerating the pace of bringing effective, new medicines to patients is one of the greatest opportunities for humanity. Our mission is to develop better drugs, faster using technology. We have built an end-to-end technology-driven drug discovery platform centered around one of the field\u2019s largest human genomics databases in neuroscience.
