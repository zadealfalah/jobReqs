Data management and analytics    \n Independently design ways to improve routine computational processes, including the relevant tradeoffs of different approaches, for decision-making purposes.    \n Transform, format, and standardize datasets for use in ongoing analyses. Perform quality checks.    \n Problem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.    \n Develop and execute diagnostics to assist in testing various analytic strategies and to evaluate modelling results.    \n Enhance and execute analytic code, statistical models, and tools to carry out functions responsive to the analytic questions to be resolved. Address and improve team-specific analytic strategies that will get used frequently by multiple people within the team.    \n Produce novel analytics, charts, graphs, and other materials to support the needs and requests of researchers, collaborators, and other stakeholders.    \n Assess results and provide input on validity.    \n Standardize code for team-specific data transformation needs (e.g. DisMod-AT) to draw upon centrally maintained databases and tools. Demonstrate understanding of code functionality and relate it to the analytic strategy.    \n Ensure team specific processes align with central analytic machinery and can draw upon and feed into that machinery seamlessly as needed.    \n Uphold Institute-wide coding, documentation, and data cataloguing standards.

Its primary goal is to \u201ccontribute to establishing international standards and methods for the compilation of statistics on the major dimensions of governance\u201d. The Praia Group has more than 100 members, including representatives from National Statistical Offices, UN agencies, multilateral and bilateral agencies, and academia. \n  The group is currently in its second phase of operations (2020-2025) and has thus far developed a Handbook on Governance Statistics for National Statistical Offices. This handbook includes sections on the conceptuzalization, measurement methodology and dissemination of statistics on eight dimensions of governance, namely non-discrimination and equality, participation, openness, access to and quality of justice, responsiveness, absence of corruption, trust, and safety and security. The handbook was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. \n  Even though the handbook is comprehensive, several gaps related to Governance statistics remain \u2013 one of these is around the use of administrative data sources to produce statistics on discrimination and inequality. Preliminary research shows that while the potential of admin data to improve the availability, granularity and timeliness of statistics for national and international monitoring of discrimination and inequalities is large, few countries have adopted a coherent and systematic approach to collecting admin data across the National Statistical System and to producing comprehensive statistics on discrimination & inequalities. The research will not only identify what is currently happening at country level, but will also prioritize actions needed to bridge the current data and capacity gaps. \n  UN Women East and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESA-RO) is therefore currently collaborating with the Praia City Group and its Task Team on Non-Discrimination & Equality to expand methodological guidance on the collection and use of administrative data that documents discrimination and inequality in all its forms, including \u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 \u2013 i.e. inequalities in development outcomes caused by laws, policies or practices that appear neutral at face value, yet are discriminatory for population groups with certain characteristics (e.g. when a requirement of a birth certificate for school enrolment discriminates against ethnic minorities or non-nationals who do not possess, or have been denied, such certificates). This links well with UN Women\u2019s agenda on the elimination of intersectional discrimination, as well as the  gender data and statistics  work done as part of the global Making Every Woman and Girl Count (Women Count) programme. One of the areas of work of the programme is to support the development of new methodologies and tools for more effective data collection, as well as the modernization of statistical practice. \n  It is within this context that the Praia City Group and UN Women are seeking the services of 5 consultants based in the Africa region. The main purpose of the consultancy will be to identify current and potential administrative data sources that can be used to produce statistics on discrimination and inequality in the region, as well as the data and capacity gaps associated with this data that need to be addressed through the development of guidelines. These  guidelines should include recommendations on quality assurance, data recording, linking with other sources, calculating indicators and the like. \n  The Task Team on Non-Discrimination & Equality has elaborated the following conceptual and measurement framework on non-discrimination and equality, which consists of 6 broad sub-categories: \n  Experiences and Perceptions of Discrimination & Harassment \n \n  Prevalence, by grounds, by different domains (\u201careas of life\u201d), by perpetrator. \n  Perceived prevalence. \n  Effects on the person. \n \n  Hate Crimes and Hate Speech  \n \n Prevalence, by type of bias motivation & type of offense. \n  Perceived prevalence, by type of bias motivation & type of offense \n \n  Reporting and Sentencing of Discrimination, Harassment and Hate Crimes  \n \n Public reporting, by type of authority & reasons for non-reporting & satisfaction. \n  Convictions & reparations provided to victims. \n \n  Attitudes Towards Minority Groups  \n \n Level of hostility vs. \u2018acceptability\u2019 towards different social or ethnic/racial groups. \n  Attitudes on equal treatment of groups, multiculturalism, integration. \n \n  Promotion of Equality \n \n  Public awareness and evaluation of national efforts to fight discrimination/harassment/hate crimes. \n  Effectiveness of national efforts to fight discrimination/harassment/hate speech. \n \n  Indirect Discrimination  \n \n Inequalities in outcomes, by grounds of discrimination. \n \n  Administrative data systems in this context is understood in its widest sense i.e. systems that capture operational data of any entity be it Government, CSOs, INGOs etc. Administrative data cannot be used to measure all of the six areas above (e.g. some areas, such as \u201c4. Attitudes Towards Minority Groups\u201d, can only be measured with survey data), but the framework provides an indication of the range of dimensions that need to be included in this work. Of relevance to administrative data systems is areas no. 1,2,3,5 and 6 above. \n  The outputs of the 5 consultants will contribute towards the design and development of a  published guidance  on how to develop and strengthen the collection and use of admin data to better measure and monitor trends on discrimination and inequalities, and generate the necessary data to inform policymaking in this area. \n  The consultants will work under the direct supervision of the UN Women ESA Regional Gender Statistics Specialist, but will also work in close collaboration with the Praia City group\u2019s Task Team on Non-Discrimination & Equality through a Working Group appointed for the purposes of this work. \n  One consultant will be appointed for each of the following sub-regions in Africa: \n  North Africa:  Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia. \n  West and Central Africa:   C\u00f4te D'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon and Gabon. \n  East Africa:   Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. \n  Southern Africa:  Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and South Africa. \n  Lusophone Countries:   Mozambique, Cape Verde \n  Consultants will be working remotely but  will be required to be based in one of the countries of the sub-region they apply for . \n  Scope of Work: \n \n  Review and refine a pre-designed data collection tool for use in each sub-region. \n  Do a desktop review of the administrative data-sources that document discrimination, inequality and the outcomes of discrimination in the targeted countries. \n  Use virtual engagements and snowball techniques to identify the state and non-state institutions that collect relevant admin data on discrimination and inequalities in the targeted countries, incl. Police & justice sector institutions; national equality bodies; national human rights institutions; ombuds institutions; service provision institutions; civil society organisations; academia and other relevant parties. \n  For each one of these admin data-producing institutions, assess and document the nature of the data holdings (variable content as well as quality); nature and degree of access to the data (notably by the NSO) and use of data for statistical production on discrimination; main challenges associated with the data and how these can be overcome (e.g. data protection, data-sharing and other ethical considerations in the collection and use of such data) \n  Identify national examples of how admin datasets are also used to monitor inequalities in outcomes resulting from indirect/structural discrimination, in key sectors e.g. health, education, justice, policing and social services (and for each sector, identify key datasets/variables/ratios/averages used for equality analysis) \n  Document the role of the NSO in the targeted countries in coordinating/quality assuring the collection of admin data on discrimination and inequalities, and the existence (or not) of mechanisms facilitating cooperation between NSOs and organizations collecting/recording the data, and with organizations that have policy responsibility for non-discrimination & equality \n  Prepare a report that clearly maps the relevant administrative data holdings in the countries studied in the sub-region; identify good practices; challenges and opportunities associated with this data (vs. other types of data e.g. survey data); make recommendations on how to improve the collection of admin data on discrimination & inequalities, its use in statistical production, and its uptake in policymaking/monitoring. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Duties and Responsibilities \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Key Deliverables: \n \n  One PowerPoint presentation per sub-region which explains how the task will be approached. This will be shared and discussed in a virtual meeting involving all 5 contracted consultants, with the opportunity to engage and influence one another\u2019s planned work strategy; \n  One report per sub-region that summarizes the results of the assessment; \n  One PowerPoint presentation which highlights the key findings per sub-region. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Competencies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Core Values: \n \n  Respect for Diversity; \n  Integrity; \n  Professionalism; \n \n  Core Competencies: \n \n  Awareness and Sensitivity Regarding Gender Issues; \n  Accountability; \n  Creative Problem Solving; \n  Effective Communication; \n  Inclusive Collaboration; \n  Stakeholder Engagement; \n  Leading by Example. \n \n  Please visit this link for more information on UN Women\u2019s Core Values and Competencies: https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/About%20Us/Employment/UN-Women-values-and-competencies-framework-en.pdf \n  Functional Competencies: \n \n  Demonstrated ability to network amongst actors in the human rights sector; \n  Competent in working with and using human rights and non-discrimination data; \n  Analytical skills; \n  Good report writing and editing skills. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Required Skills and Experience \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Education: \n \n  Minimum master\u2019s degree in law, human rights, development studies or related field; \n  Holding some formal qualifications in statistics or demography will be an advantage. \n \n  Experience: \n \n  Minimum 10 years' experience in human rights and non-discrimination related work in at least one of the countries in the sub-region you are applying for; \n  Minimum 5 years research and data analysis experience; \n  Work experience in human rights and non-discrimination work with different organizations, in more than one country in the sub-region for which you apply, will be an advantage; \n \n  Language Requirements: \n \n  Fluency in English, French, Portuguese or Arabic is required depending on the sub-region concerned.

Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what\u2019s important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team\u2019s time and effort.\n    \n \n \n  Data-Driven  - Leaders work backward from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.\n    \n \n \n  Make Moonshine  - Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They\u2019re resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.\n    \n \n \n  Insist on the Highest Standards  - Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high-quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.\n    \n \n \n  Bias for Action  - Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don\u2019t need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk-taking because they know that in business, speed wins.\n    \n \n \n  Have Integrity; Earn Trust  - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.\n    \n \n \n  Hire and Develop the Best  - Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.\n    \n \n \n  Ownership  - Leaders think long-term and don\u2019t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.\n    \n \n \n  Disagree and Commit  - Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.\n    \n \n \n  Dive Deep  - Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ.\n    \n \n \n  Deliver Results  - Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.\n    \n \n \n  Disclaimer: \n \n \n \n  The above statements are intended to describe the general nature and level of work performed by people assigned to thisfication.

More than two-thirds of Upstart loans are approved instantly and are fully automated. \n  Upstart is a digital-first company, which means that most Upstarters can live and work anywhere in the U.S. We also have offices in San Mateo, California; Columbus, Ohio; and Austin, Texas. \n  Most Upstarters join us because they connect with our mission of enabling access to effortless credit based on true risk. If you are energized by the impact you can make at Upstart, we\u2019d love to hear from you! \n \n The Team: \n  We\u2019re a small team building our own business. Our first product, launched in summer \u201823, is a home equity line of credit (HELOC) for homeowners. Our next product is a home loan (mortgage) for homebuyers. It will be the most complex product Upstart has built to date, and we need more talented, creative engineers to help us make it happen! \n  Why Mortgage?  This industry is the largest category of consumer credit in the US, with over $2 trillion in originations last year. This is where Upstart can make its biggest impact. \n  Why us?  The market has left behind millions of Americans with imperfect credit or difficult-to-document income. Serving these customers is Upstart\u2019s bread and butter, and it\u2019s core to our mission. Because we use machine learning to assess creditworthiness versus a fixed formula more than a decade old (FICO), we\u2019re able to extend loans to prospective homeowners that our competitors just can\u2019t. We\u2019ve proven this model with personal loans and auto loans, and now we want to bring this access to where families feel it the most:  where they live. \n  We want our team to reflect the people we\u2019re serving. To serve customers at the fringes, we need people who  think  at the fringes\u2014weird, quirky, out-of-the-box do-ers who reason from first principles and not from the status quo.
